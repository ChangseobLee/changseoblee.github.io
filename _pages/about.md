I am a Ph.D. student in **[the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.ubc.ca/)** at **[the University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/)**, working with **[Prof. Prashant Nair](https://prashantnair.bitbucket.io/)** in the Systems and Architectures (STAR) Lab.

My research interests are in the areas of computer architecture and systems, security, and memory systems. I am particularly interested in building secure and reliable computing systems. Currently, my research is focused on building Row Hammer attacks and defenses.

Before I joined UBC, I received my M.S. in **[Electronics and Computer Engineering](http://electronic.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/main/index.php)** at **[Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng)**, in 2020. In my Master's dissertation, I worked on developing a robust yet low overhead hardware-based Row Hammer mitigation method. I also received my B.S. in **[Electronic Engineering](http://electronic.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/main/index.php)** at **[Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng)**, in 2018. In my Bachelor's dissertation, I implemented an FPGA-based CNN accelerator using SDSoC.
