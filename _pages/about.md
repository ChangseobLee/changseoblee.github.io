I am a Ph.D. student in **[the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.ubc.ca/)** at **[the University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/)**, working with **[Prof. Prashant Nair](https://prashantnair.bitbucket.io/)** in the Systems and Architectures (STAR) Lab.  

My research interests are in the areas of computer architecture and systems, security, and memory systems. I am particularly interested in building secure and reliable computing systems. Currently, my research is focused on building new Row Hammer attacks and defenses.

Before I joined UBC, I received my M.S. in **[Electronics and Computer Engineering]((https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng))** at **[Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng)**, in 2020. In my Master's dissertation, I worked on developing a robust yet low overhead hardware-based RowHammer mitigation method. I also received my B.S. in **[Electronic Engineering]((https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng))** at **[Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng)**, in 2018. In my Bachelor's dissertation, I implemented an FPGA-based CNN accelerator using SDSoC.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
